Modelling and animation of complex 3D objects is difficult.
It is time consuming and requires expensive tools. The goal of this project is to create an easier way to model 
complex 3D objects and capture their motion using a Kinect sensor. For example, modelling of the human body is 
already possible, but it requires many cameras and expensive software. 
The project will investigate doing this using Kinect and existing open source drivers and APIâ€™s.

This repo was created from an svn repo at: http://code.google.com/p/3d-kinect-modelling/
Some of the revision history was lost for this reason, the code is still at the above site, and history can be viewed there.
The project is moving in a different direction, so this should not be an issue.
Original contributors included myself, Kyle Milz (https://github.com/krwm) and Romain Clement.
