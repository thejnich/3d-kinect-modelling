{"name":"3d-kinect-modelling","body":"3d-kinect-modelling\r\n===================\r\n\r\n##Goal\r\nModelling and animation of complex 3D objects is difficult.  \r\nIt is time consuming and requires expensive tools. The goal of this project is to create an easier way to model \r\ncomplex 3D objects and capture their motion using a Kinect sensor. For example, modelling of the human body is \r\nalready possible, but it requires many cameras and expensive software.   \r\nThe project will investigate doing this using Kinect and existing open source drivers and APIâ€™s.\r\n\r\n##Current State\r\nCurrently the application does no real modelling. It shows the rgb feed from the Kinect, a color map of the depth\r\ndata from the Kinect, and a point cloud of the scene, with a texture mapped on top. \r\nThe user can select various objects in the scene to be shown individually.  \r\nA crude mesh can be created, but only of what the Kinect can see at any one time. Occlusion is not handled, this is the\r\ncurrent focus. The point cloud/mesh can be exported in various formats.\r\n\r\n##History\r\nThis started as a class project, and is now being extended.\r\nOriginal contributors included myself, Kyle Milz (https://github.com/krwm) and Romain Clement (http://www.romainclement.com/).  \r\nThis repo was created from an svn repo at: http://code.google.com/p/3d-kinect-modelling/\r\nSome of the revision history was lost for this reason, the code is still at the above site, and history can be viewed there.\r\nThe project is moving in a different direction, so this should not be an issue.  \r\n\r\n##Site\r\n[GitHub Page](http://thejnich.github.com/3d-kinect-modelling/)\r\n","tagline":"3d modelling using Microsoft Kinect","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
