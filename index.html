<h2>Goal</h2>

<p>Modelling and animation of complex 3D objects is difficult.<br>
It is time consuming and requires expensive tools. The goal of this project is to create an easier way to model 
complex 3D objects and capture their motion using a Kinect sensor. For example, modelling of the human body is 
already possible, but it requires many cameras and expensive software.<br>
The project will investigate doing this using Kinect and existing open source drivers and APIâ€™s.</p>

<h2>Current State</h2>

<p>Currently the application does no real modelling. It shows the rgb feed from the Kinect, a color map of the depth
data from the Kinect, and a point cloud of the scene, with a texture mapped on top. 
The user can select various objects in the scene to be shown individually.<br>
A crude mesh can be created, but only of what the Kinect can see at any one time. Occlusion is not handled, this is the
current focus. The point cloud/mesh can be exported in various formats.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>This started as a class project, and is now being extended.
Original contributors included myself, Kyle Milz (<a href="https://github.com/krwm">https://github.com/krwm</a>) and Romain Clement (<a href="http://www.romainclement.com/">http://www.romainclement.com/</a>).<br>
This repo was created from an svn repo at: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/3d-kinect-modelling/">http://code.google.com/p/3d-kinect-modelling/</a>
Some of the revision history was lost for this reason, the code is still at the above site, and history can be viewed there.
The project is moving in a different direction, so this should not be an issue.  </p>
